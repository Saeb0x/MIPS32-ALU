# MIPS32-ALU
This repository houses designs and code for my Final Year Project, centered on designing a 32-bit MIPS ALU. Including Logisim designs for foundational understanding, VHDL implementation of a Single-Cycle MIPS CPU, and a MIPS Assembler written in C++ to define and execute custom test programs.
